Description: Bootstrap is an Orchard theme constructed using the Bootstrap template system from Twitter (http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/). The Sidebar has been mapped to the AsideFirst & AsideSecond zones which will automatically collapse if there is no content. The Search box and User dropdown in the header can be turned on/off by commenting out the shapes in Layout.cshtml. The theme can either be a fixed width & centered layout or a fluid layout. Simply change all "container" class tags to "container-fluid" and "row" class tags to "row-fluid".
